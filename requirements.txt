# These requirements are for running tests and the sample_site, the library
# itself only needs a subset, see setup.py for that list
#
# IMPORTANT!!!!
#
# Something funky happens when you upgrade to tox 4 with this project, it
# installs the dependencies but then fails to load them when running the
# tests. After trying to fix it for 3 hours and comparing differences to
# other working projects, I have given up. Use tox<4!!!!
